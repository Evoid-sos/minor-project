    <string name="cyber_security_guidelines_details">
                    Make the passwords more complicated by combining letters, numbers, special
                        characters (minimum 10 characters in total) and change them on a regular
                        basis.\n\nUse anti-virus/malware software\n\nPrevent spyware from infiltrating your computer by installing and updating
                        anti-spyware software.\n\nMake sure your social networking profiles (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
                        MSN, etc.) are set to private.\n\nBe careful what information you post online. Once it is on the Internet,
                        it is there forever\n\nTurn on automatic updates to prevent potential attacks on older
                        software.\n\nPublic Wi-Fi, a.k.a. “Hot Spots”, are also vulnerable. Avoid conducting
                        financial or corporate transactions on these networks.\n\nAlways think before you click on a link or file of unknown
                        origin.\n\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="fire_guidelines_details">
        Immediately pull the nearest fire alarm as you exit the building.\n\nWhen evacuating the building, be sure to feel
        doors for heat before opening them to be sure there is no fire danger on the other side.\n\nIf there is smoke in the air,
        stay low to the ground, to reduce inhalation exposure. Keep one hand on the wall to prevent disorientation and
        crawl to the nearest exit.\n\nOnce away, and clear from danger, call your emergency contact and inform them of the fire.\n\nGo to your refuge
        area and await further instructions from emergency personnel.\n
    </string>

    <string name="medic_guidelines_details">
                    Keep a first-aid kit handy at home and work.\n\nHaving an emergency app on your
        smartphone allows first responders access to critical medical information stored on your phone without knowing the
                        passcode on the phone’s lock screen. Information can include prescriptions,
                        allergies, medical conditions, blood type and emergency contacts.\n\nIf you do have to go the E.R., be prepared.
        Bring a list of current
                        medications, including how long the medicine has been taken and how
                        often.\n
    </string>

    <string name="accident_guidelines_details">
                     The first and foremost thing is your own safety, this will enable you to
                        help others and get time to analyze the complete situation with a better
                        viewpoint.\n\nOnce you have reached safety, the next step is to make sure that everyone
                        involved in the accident is safe and assess your own and their possible
                        injuries.\n\nOnce everyone involved has been diagnosed to be safe, it is imperative
                        that you file a police report of the accident at the earliest and in as
                        detailed a manner as you can manage.\n
    </string>

    <string name="crime_guidelines_details">
                    Be AWARE of your surroundings at all times and trust your INSTINCTS.\n\nWalk with your head
        upright. Make eye contact. Thieves often target victims
                        who are not paying attention to their surroundings or who are looking
                        down.\n\nPlan your route, know where you are going before leaving.\n\nStick to well-lighted, well-traveled streets.
        Avoid shortcuts through
                        wooded areas, parking lots, or alleys.\n
